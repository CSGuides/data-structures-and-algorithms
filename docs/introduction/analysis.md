Analysis
========

Two main factors: time and space.

## Experimental Analysis



## Mathematical Analysis

It is possible to build a mathematical model to describe the running time of any program. The total running time of a program is determined by two factors:

1. The cost of executing each statement
2. The frequency of execution of each statement

| Name | Growth Rate | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Constant | $$ 1 $$ | statement | add two numbers |
| Logarithmic | $$ \text{log}\,n $$ | divide in half | binary search |
| Linear | $$ n $$ | loop | find maximum in array |
| Linearithmic | $$ n\,\text{log}\,n $$ | divide and conquer | mergesort |
| Quadratic | $$ n^2 $$ | double loop | check all pairs |
| Cubic | $$ n^3 $$ | triple loop | check all triples |
| Exponential | $$ 2^n $$ | exhaustive search | check all subsets |
