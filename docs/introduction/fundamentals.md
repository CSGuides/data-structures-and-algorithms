Fundamentals
============

**Algorithms** are methods for problem solving suitable for computer implementation.

**Data structures** are schemes for organizing data that makes them amenable to efficient processing by an algorithm.

Algorithms are closely linked with data structures. Data structures exist as the byproducts or end products of algorithms and that we must therefore study them in order to understand the algorithms. Simple algorithms can give rise to complicated data structures and, conversely, complicated algorithms can use simple data structures.
